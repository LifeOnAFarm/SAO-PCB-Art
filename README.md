# SAO PCB Art 
Created in the lead up to DefCon 26 #BadgeLife

## Getting Started

Welcome to a collection of my PCB Shitty Add-On (SAO) files.

Here you will find svg images, schematics, gerbers and all the Kicad files you need to edit and make your own SAO PCB. I recommend @MrTwinkleTwink's video on how to convert svg images to Kicad files using Inkscape if you want to make any board chances (https://youtu.be/61NFK9KW).
