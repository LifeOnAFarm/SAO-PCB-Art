Inkscape and Kicad files for my Shitty Add-On PCBs - Shy Guy and Chain Chomp

## Getting Started

Welcome to a collection of my PCB Shitty Add-On (SAO) files.

Here you will find a svg images of the PCBs and all the schematics, gerbers and Kicad files. I recommend @MrTwinkleTwink's video on how to convert svg images to Kicad files using Inkscape if you want to make any board chances (https://youtu.be/61NFK9KW).
  
First off, as a warning, I'm by no stretch of the imagination a professional PCB designer and while I have tested the circuit on a similar project I've yet to receive and test this PCB (Will update when I do). Make sure to check through the schematics and make any changes you feel fit (and try not to have an aneurysm when you look at my wiring).

## Quirks:

There are a few quirks to this board. One ~~flaw~~ feature is that the switch doesn't power the PCB on and off, but switches the power from the 8-Ball circuit to the Shitty Add-On headers. Another quirk you might notice in Kicad, is that I couldn't find the footprint for a SW-200D tilt switch so I just used a similar sized component.

## Components You Will Need:

- 1 x SW-200D Tilt Switch

- 3 x 0.1" 2x2 Female Headers

- 8 x 1206 LEDS (Solder these with the top of the LED facing towards the PCB board)

- 1 x Keystone 1058 2032 Coincell Battery Holder

- 1 x CD4017BM Decade counter

- 1 x 0805 10K Resistor

- 1 x 0805 220 Resistor

- 1 x Switch Slide JS202011SCQN
